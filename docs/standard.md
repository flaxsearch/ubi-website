# The User Behavior Insights (UBI) Standard

:material-link: See the latest version of the [UBI Standard](https://www.github.com/o19s/ubi)!

The most important part of UBI is its standard that defines how queries and user events are defined.

UBI requires coordination between the client (a browser, a mobile app, etc) and the backend, which is documented using JSON Schema.

The Schema is documented by itself, but it's much easier to get "the big picture" with a graphical representation:
